# BackInPack

The BackInPack plugin even offers you an entire double space crate. The server administrator can determine how much space he wants to give the player at his disposal. The administrator can also allocate the appropriate amount of space in the backpack for specific players or do it using the permissions.


## Features

After death, the administrator can decide what to do with the player's items:
- save - items are saved
- delete - items are removed from the backpack
- drop - items drop from the player

Thanks to the permission, you can also change the size of players' backpacks and keep their items in their backpacks after death.

✨ The plugin also offers sounds and visual effects.

---

The backpack can also be a portable item, thanks to which you will have full access to it instead of hitting the /backpack command.

---

Compatible with the [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) plugin with included over 30 placeholders.

## Deployment
In the `pom.xml` file you need to provide the path where your `.jar` file will be created.

```xml
<configuration>
    <outputDirectory>{OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}</outputDirectory>
    <finalName>BackInPack-DEV</finalName>
</configuration>
```

You're all set to receive your `.jar` file. Running this command will compile the project into a `.jar` file that can be used on the server.

> package -f pom.xml
